## Peering Information

Omnificent Systems has an open peering policy, however we do have several basic requirements:

* Peering partners must not be a current Omnificent Systems transit customer.

* Peering partners must maintain a 24x7 Network Operations Center.

* Peering partners must cooperate in the troubleshooting of any peering related issues, denial of service attacks, UCE, hacking or virus penetration.

* Peering partners are prohibited from abusing our peering relationship by routing transitive traffic through `AS395077` or resetting any next-hop.

* Peering partners are requested to peer at all common peering points.

* We reserve the right to decline new peer relationships with anyone as we see fit and to terminate any existing peer relationships at any time with 30 days notice.

* We reserve the right to change this policy with 30 days notice.
