## Large BGP Communities

Omnificent Systems leverages [Large BGP Communities](http://largebgpcommunities.net) to provide extremely granular control capabilities to transit customers, peers, and internally maintained customers.

Unlike the Extended Community format introduced in [RFC 4360](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4360), which is  comprised of one 32 bit field broken up into two 16 bit fields, large communities are comprised of one 96 bit field, delineated into three 32 bit fields.

### Common Community Type Differences

Standard Communities ([RFC 1997](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1997)):

`NO-EXPORT`

`NO-ADVERTISE`

`NO-ADVERTISE-SUBCONFED`

---

Extended Communities ([RFC 4360](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4360)):

`0-65535 : 0-65535`

---

Large Communities ([RFC 8092](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8092)):

`0-4294967295 : 0-4294967295 : 0-4294967295`

Typically, the three fields are structured as `Operator ASN : Function : Parameter`.

For example:

`ASN : Received from POP : osCloud AZ01` logic would be written as:

`395077:100:11`

`ASN : Prepend 3x : LEVEL 3` Logic would be written as:

`395077:2001:3356`

---

Recommendations for deployment can be found in [RFC 8195](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8195).

### Community Allocations

The Omnificent Systems community structure is allocated into the following buckets:

| ASN      | Function          | Parameter  | Description      |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| `395077` | `0-999`           | `*`        | Informational    |
| `395077` | `1000-1999`       | `*`        | Internal Actions |
| `395077` | `2000-2999`       | `*`        | External Actions |
| `395077` | `3000-3999`       | `*`        | Security Actions |
| `395077` | `4000-4294967295` | `*`        | Unassigned       |
