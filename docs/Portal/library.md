osCloud provides a pre-populated catalog of Virtual Machine’s pre-built and patched. Also osCloud provides media to deploy your own virtual machines. The Public_Shared catalog should already be connected to your organization, which can be used for common installation media. If you want to upload your own installation media, click “Add” on this screen to create your own catalog. The following screen will prompt you for a name, and an optional description, before allowing you to click “OK”.

## Uploading Installation Media
Once you have created a catalog, click the “Media & Other” menu item to upload files to it.
